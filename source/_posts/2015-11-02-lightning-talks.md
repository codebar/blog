At the beginning of weekly workshops in London, we encourage our coaches and
students to help kick off the session with a lightning talk. We're not strict
about the topics, but we ask that they be oriented towards programming, since
that's what we're all here to learn.  We've had some
awesome lightning talks in the past, on everything from naming variables to
regular expressions to the role of programming in medical technology.

I encourage everyone, students and coaches alike, to try their hand at
writing and delivering a lightning talk early on in their software development
career. It's one of the best ways to boost your confidence, and codebar is one of
the safest spaces for you to try something new. The process of organising your
thoughts and putting them into a slidedeck is not only great practice if you are
considering speaking at conferences in the future, I believe it also makes you
a more effective communicator and mentor.

Thanks to Najaf's suggestion on Slack, I've decided to put together a quick
document here on how to get started with giving lightning talks, at codebar or
elsewhere. In general, at codebar we ask that you limit your lightning talk to
*five minutes* of presentation, with a few minutes afterward for questions.
Running over is okay, but we may cut you off if you start to go over 15
minutes, because we want to give everyone enough time to do some coding!

This is a loose list of guidelines, not a hard set of rules --
compiled from my experiences at codebar and from over four years of university
debating.

#### 1. Determine the scope of your talk.

Generally, all technical topics are fair game, but some are better than others
for a 5-minute talk. If you're choosing a very broad topic such as "Deploying a
web application" or "CSS", try to narrow it to a specific sub-topic, for
example, "Getting started with the Heroku CLI" or "How CSS floats work". Sometimes
well-intentioned lightning talks run over time, or end up with less
substance than intended, because they are not properly scoped. It is also worth
pointing out that while talks about back-end development and hardware are
definitely welcome, the majority of students will be more experienced with
front-end web development. If you choose to venture away from front-end web
dev, try to err on the side of offering more context and terminology
definitions.

#### 2. Structure the ideas you want to talk about.

People often struggle with how to organise ideas for a short talk. If a talk is
disorganised, listeners may become confused or overwhelmed by information. I've
found that in such a short amount of time, there are two formats that tend to
work really well:

- Explain a problem and a solution.

  Pretty much everything in the tech world is a solution to some problem. The
  problem-solution format is a great way to give some context to what you're
  about to explain. I find that spending 1 minute on the problem and 4 minutes
  on explaining the solution tends to work well.

- Divide up the talk into 2-3 key points.

  This is especially useful if you choose a very broad topic. For example, if
  you are presenting about Sass, it's impossible to explain the entire Sass API
  in five minutes, but you could pick your three favorite features and contrast
  them to regular CSS. It helps to have some sort of generalisation or tie-in
  at the end to give some overall shape to the talk.

#### 3. Keep it interesting for your audience.

At codebar, talks that are language-agnostic are much preferred over
presentations on language-specific features or frameworks. Students are at
different levels of familiarity with web development, so while you should not
shy away from presenting advanced topics, try your best to explain things in
plain language. Explain the impacts on end-users and the tech community, if
applicable. As a presenter, it helps me to always be asking the question, "Why
does this matter?"

#### 4. Don't live-code.

This is probably the most controversial tip, but please trust me -- live-coding
and "five minute presentation" do not tend to go together. If you want to
demonstrate something, prepare slides with screenshots, and invite students to
try it on their own afterward. Something always goes wrong, and it never winds
up being five minutes...

Hopefully this provides a useful
jumping-off point for you to start writing your own talk. If you ever need
support, or if you have an idea but want to bounce it around before committing
it to a slidedeck, come on over to codebar's [Slack
