This blog post is a little different than the rest. **This is a public ask for monetary contributions for codebar**, for the purpose of running future workshops and events at all codebar chapters throughout the UK and internationally.

As you know, codebar is run 100% by volunteers. The organisers are not compensated for the time we spend facilitating weekly workshops and events. We do this because we believe in the core mission of codebar: to make tech more diverse and accessible to more people. It is no exaggeration to say that codebar's existence is made possible by the generosity of the coaches and venue sponsors who have donated their time, space, and money in the past. For that, we are sincerely grateful.

If you've tried to book a spot at a workshop before, only to find that it was already fully subscribed, then you've experienced some of the growing pains that codebar is currently undergoing. We've tried to offset some of this by offering an additional workshop in South London every other week.

However, adding more venues and chapters throughout the UK to try to meet growing demand has created a growing financial burden on codebar's limited resources. When a venue offers space but is unable to provide food, we graciously accept the offer for space upfront because we would rather hold a workshop that costs money for codebar than not have that workshop happen. This matters to us.

This is an ask, to anybody who has ever benefited from codebar, as a student, coach, venue host, or perhaps employer.

## We need your support.

Your donation of any amount will go directly back into running workshops. Here is a breakdown of what it costs to run codebar London:

* Providing food for a workshop of ~60 people: £250-300
* One month of server space: £20
* Cost of name tag stationery for the year: £60

If you are a professional in the grassroots fundraising space or have worked on fundraising projects in the past, please get in touch with your ideas: hello@codebar.io

Here's the one thing that we pledge to **never** do: We will never charge money to students to attend workshops. This is the one thing that is off the table, and always will be off the table. We are committed to the principle of accessibility for __everyone__.

So, if you can give, please give. codebar is a registered non-profit organization -- consider asking your employer to match your contribution. If you can't give today, don't worry, you can still help us by sharing this post or retweeting us.
