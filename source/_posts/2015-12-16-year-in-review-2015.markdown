codebar students and organisers have also had the opportunity to attend some great events and conferences this year, not in small part because of the support of our sponsors:

Two organisers and two students had the opportunity to represent codebar at [Bath Ruby 2015](http://2016.bathruby.uk/) thanks to a generous donation from [shutl](https://shutl.com/uk/).
We have sent one organiser and two students to [eurucamp 2015](http://2015.eurucamp.org/), made possible by [Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart) and [George Sheppard](https://twitter.com/fuzzmonkey).
We have sent four students to [EuRuKo 2015](http://www.euruko2015.org/) thanks to a donation by [shutl](https://shutl.com/uk/).
We had the opportunity to give a lightning talk at [re:develop 2015](http://redevelop.io/), who have also been greatly supportive in helping us set up our Bournemouth chapter.
Lastly, thank you to [Front-end London](http://www.frontendlondon.co.uk/) and Made by Many for supporting us all year round with complimentary tickets for codebar students to their monthly event.

2015 was also the year we got some recognition for our work. We have been nominated for a [net award](https://thenetawards.com/), where we made it onto the shortlist in the [Grassroots Event of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/grassroots/) category. Our founder, Despo Pentara, has also been recognised by the UK Prime Minister where she received a [Points of Light](https://www.pointsoflight.gov.uk/coding-access-champion/) award for her work with codebar.

All of this would not have been possible without the generous support of our sponsors. In no particular order these were some of the individuals and companies we are thankful for in 2015:
